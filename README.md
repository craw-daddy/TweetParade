Repository for Twitter collector and webpages to control access to collector

This repository contains the functions, files, etc for the Twitter Collection 
tool.  This tool was initially written by Thomas Gorry and David Hamilton. 

This uses the "phirehose" library for the main functionality of the Collector.  

The accompanying webpages are for controlling the collector, and allowing for 
some display of the collected information in a "nice" fashion.
